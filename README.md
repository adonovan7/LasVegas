# LasVegas
Using UCI's Las Vegas Strips dataset to outline basics of a data science project using R for newcomers

R is a useful language for conducting basic exploratory analysis and statitical procedures on datasets. This repo gives an example of a standard data science project using a data set on hotels in Las Vegas.

## Some Basic Info:
**What is R?**
R is an open source programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics 
* developed by programmers for other programmers
* meant to share code and packages in the community and promote development and growth

**What is R Studio?**
RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment for R

**Some terms to know**:
* Open Source: developed by programmers for other programmers; allows people to share code and packages in the community and promote development and growth; usually free to use and universally accessible
* IDE (integrated development environment)
  * provides a GUI builder, a text or code editor, a compiler and/or interpreter and a debugger.
* GUI: graphical user interface (all of the buttons, files, and pretty options you see)
* Debugger: will test and "debug" (find problems/defects) your code
* Compiler:  computer software that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language)
  
   ** note: if you want to learn more, I suggest googling high and low level programming as well as abstraction
* Markdown: a lightweight markup language (simple and easier to read/write) with plain text formatting syntax, designed so that it can be converted to HTML
